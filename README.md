BulkyBook is my first MVC project, it's a light app for books library with multiple type of users, different type of accounts, discounts, payments, carts, notification, and browsing.

in this project I'm using N-Tier Archticture, and design patterns like Repository, Unit of Work, and design principals like saperation of concern, dependancy inversion, encapsulation, polimorphism..

**the project still in progress**
